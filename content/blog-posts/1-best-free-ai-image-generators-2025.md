## AI Image Generation Tips

### 1. **Write Better Prompts**

‚ùå Bad: "a dog"
‚úÖ Good: "golden retriever puppy playing in autumn leaves, professional photography, natural lighting"

**Prompt Formula**:
```
[Subject] + [Action] + [Setting] + [Style] + [Lighting] + [Details]
```

### 2. **Use Style Keywords**

- **Photography**: "photorealistic", "DSLR", "bokeh", "natural lighting"
- **Art**: "oil painting", "watercolor", "digital art", "concept art"
- **3D**: "octane render", "unreal engine", "3D render"
- **Specific**: "Studio Ghibli style", "cyberpunk", "art nouveau"

### 3. **Iterate and Refine**

Don't expect perfection on first try:
1. Generate initial image
2. Identify what to improve
3. Adjust prompt with more details
4. Regenerate

### 4. **Leverage Negative Prompts**

Tell the AI what you DON'T want:
- "no blur"
- "not cartoon"
- "exclude text"
- "no watermark"

*(Note: Not all tools support negative prompts)*

### 5. **Start Simple, Add Details**

Build prompts incrementally:
1. Basic: "mountain landscape"
2. Better: "mountain landscape at sunset"
3. Best: "dramatic mountain landscape at golden hour, snow-capped peaks, reflection in lake, vibrant colors, professional photography"
