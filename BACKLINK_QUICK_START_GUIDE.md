Website: https://aiezzy.com
Email: [Your Email]

Response:

[2-3 paragraphs directly answering their query with specific, quotable insights]

[Example for "What are the latest AI trends?"]
"The biggest shift in AI is moving from single-purpose tools to multi-modal platforms. Users are tired of juggling five different AI subscriptions—one for chat, another for images, another for research. The next wave of AI applications will combine capabilities seamlessly.

From a technical standpoint, frameworks like LangGraph are enabling developers to build sophisticated multi-agent systems that coordinate multiple AI models in real-time. This is how we built Aiezzy—integrating GPT-4o for conversation, FAL AI for image generation, and Tavily for web search into one cohesive experience.

The key challenge isn't the AI models themselves—those are increasingly commoditized. It's the orchestration layer and user experience. Companies that nail seamless multi-modal workflows will win in 2025."

[End with a one-sentence quotable soundbite]
"The future of AI isn't about better models; it's about better integration."

Available for follow-up questions or additional context.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

3. **First Comment (Maker Comment):**
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Your Name], and I built Aiezzy because I was tired of juggling 5 different AI subscriptions.

The idea: What if you could chat, analyze images, generate visuals, and create videos all in one place?

How it works:
- Upload an image → Ask questions about it
- Type a prompt → Get a stunning image (powered by FAL AI)
- Say "edit this image..." → Natural language editing
- Request "turn this into a video" → Text-to-video generation

Under the hood:
Built with LangGraph multi-agent architecture coordinating GPT-4o, FAL AI, and Tavily in real-time. Biggest technical challenge was managing context across different modalities without race conditions.

Current status:
- Free beta (v0.1)
- 100+ beta users
- New features shipping weekly

I'd love your feedback:
1. What AI capability would you use most?
2. Any features you'd like to see?
3. How much would you pay for this? (planning freemium)

Also happy to answer technical questions about building multi-agent AI systems!

Hi [Journalist First Name],

I've been following your excellent AI coverage, especially [specific recent article]. Your piece on [topic] really resonated because [genuine reason].

I have a story idea that might interest [Publication] readers:

**The Hidden Technical Challenge of Multi-Modal AI**

Everyone's racing to build "AI that does everything," but most attempts fail quietly. The problem isn't the AI models (those are commoditized)—it's the orchestration layer.

**Why it matters:**
- Users want unified AI experiences, not 5 subscriptions
- Technical challenge: coordinating models without context bleeding
- Economic pressure: AI API costs can explode with poor architecture
- Industry shift: Single-purpose tools → multi-modal platforms

**What I can offer:**
- Technical deep-dive into multi-agent architecture
- Real production data from Aiezzy (multi-modal AI platform)
- Insights on cost optimization (our API costs are 70% lower than naive approach)
- Perspective on which AI capabilities users actually combine

**My background:**
[Your Name], founder/developer of Aiezzy. [Relevant experience in AI/ML/software].

I built Aiezzy to solve this exact problem—combining GPT-4o, FAL AI, and web search in one seamless interface. Happy to share the technical challenges, what worked, what didn't.

No pressure if this doesn't fit your beat or [Publication]'s current editorial focus. Either way, keep up the great work!

## Critical Success Factors

### What Determines Success:

1. **Consistency** > Intensity
   - Better: 2 hours daily for 30 days
   - Worse: 20 hours in one weekend, then nothing

2. **Quality** > Quantity
   - 10 high-DA backlinks > 100 low-quality directories
   - Personalized outreach > Mass email blasts

3. **Genuine Value** > Self-Promotion
   - Help first, link second
   - Share expertise generously
   - Build relationships, not transactions

4. **Tracking** > Guessing
   - Measure everything
   - Double down on what works
   - Eliminate what doesn't

5. **Patience** > Impatience
   - Some tactics take 2-3 months (guest posts, PR)
   - Compound effect builds over time
   - Don't give up after 1-2 rejections

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Submitting to spammy directories** → Focus on curated, high-DA platforms
❌ **Generic outreach emails** → Personalize every message
❌ **Ignoring follow-ups** → 50% of responses come from 2nd/3rd follow-up
❌ **Over-promoting on Reddit** → Provide value first, link later
❌ **Neglecting review platforms** → Reviews build credibility for all channels
❌ **Giving up on HARO** → It's a numbers game, keep responding
❌ **Not tracking results** → You can't optimize what you don't measure
❌ **Focusing only on DA** → Relevance matters more than raw DA
❌ **Buying backlinks** → Google penalties aren't worth it
❌ **Expecting instant results** → SEO is a 3-6 month game

## What to Do Next

### If You Have Limited Time (5 hours/week):

**Focus on:**
1. AI directories (Week 1-2)
