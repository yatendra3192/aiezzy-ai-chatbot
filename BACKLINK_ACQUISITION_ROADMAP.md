Subject: Story Idea - Multi-Agent AI Systems Going Mainstream

Hi [Journalist Name],

I've been following your excellent coverage of [specific article they wrote] and thought you might be interested in a story angle about the rise of multi-modal AI applications.

Story Angle:
While ChatGPT dominates headlines, a new wave of AI tools are combining multiple capabilities (chat, vision, image generation, video) into unified platforms. This represents a shift from single-purpose AI to comprehensive AI workspaces.

Why It Matters:
- Users want integrated solutions, not 5 different AI subscriptions
- Technical challenges of coordinating multiple AI models in real-time
- Economic pressure forcing AI startups to differentiate from ChatGPT
- Emergence of frameworks like LangGraph enabling multi-agent systems

I'd be happy to provide:
- Technical insights on multi-agent architecture
- User data on multi-modal AI usage patterns
- Perspective from building Aiezzy (https://aiezzy.com), which combines GPT-4o, FAL AI, and Tavily
- Connections to other developers in this space

No pressure—I know you're busy. Just thought this could be interesting for [Publication] readers.

Best regards,
