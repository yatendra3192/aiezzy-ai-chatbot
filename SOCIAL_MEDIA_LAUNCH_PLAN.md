I tried 10 "free" PDF converters.

9 of them:
❌ Charge after 2 conversions
❌ Add watermarks
❌ Require email signup
❌ Limit file size to 10MB

AIezzy:
✅ Actually free (unlimited)
✅ No watermarks
✅ No signup
✅ Files up to 100MB

Finally found one that doesn't lie about being "free"

### LinkedIn Article (Post Separately):

**Title**: "Why I Built a Free PDF Converter in 2025 (And Why It Matters)"

```markdown
The "free" PDF converter landscape is broken.

Here's what I discovered testing 15 popular converters:

❌ 12 charged after 2-3 conversions
❌ 10 added watermarks
❌ 8 required email signup
❌ 5 limited files to 10MB
❌ 3 sold email addresses to marketers

Only 2 were genuinely free. And they had ads everywhere.

## The Problem: Subscription Fatigue

Between Zoom, Slack, Notion, Adobe, Grammarly, Canva, and dozens more, professionals pay $200-500/month in SaaS subscriptions.

Adding $10-15/month for a PDF converter feels wrong.

## The Solution: AIezzy

I built AIezzy with a simple mission: provide professional tools for free, forever.

**20 PDF Tools Available Now:**
- Word, Excel, PowerPoint conversions
- JPG, PNG image conversions
- Compress, merge, split, rotate PDFs
- PDF to text, CSV, HTML
- And 10 more

**Key Principles:**
1. **No Trials** - Free means free, not "free for 7 days"
2. **No Signup** - Privacy-first, no data collection
3. **No Watermarks** - Professional quality output
4. **Unlimited Use** - Convert 1 file or 1,000 files

## How It's Free Forever

**Tech Stack:**
- Open-source Python/Flask
- Cloud infrastructure on Railway
- AI models: OpenAI GPT-4o, FAL AI
- Minimal operational costs

**Revenue Model:**
Currently donation-supported. Considering:
- Optional premium features (advanced AI models)
- API access for developers
- White-label licensing for businesses

But the core 20 PDF tools? Free forever.

## Beyond PDF Conversion

AIezzy also includes:
- AI Image Generator (nano-banana + Gemini)
- Video Creation (text-to-video, image-to-video)
- GPT-4o Powered Chat
- Multi-image Fusion

All free. All unlimited. All no-signup.
